      <h1>About SimplifiED</h1>
      <p>
       SimplifiED is more than just an app — it's your intelligent study partner built to decode complexity and unlock clarity. In today’s fast-paced academic environment, students are constantly bombarded with overwhelming information, dense texts, and unfamiliar jargon. SimplifiED exists to cut through that noise.

Born out of a passion for accessible learning, SimplifiED was designed with a clear mission: to empower every student, regardless of background or ability, to truly understand what they’re reading. Whether it's breaking down complex passages, summarizing key ideas, finding definitions instantly, or generating relevant questions — SimplifiED bridges the gap between what’s written and what’s understood.

It’s not just an assistant; it’s a cognitive companion. Every feature — from smart summaries to readability scoring, definition lookups to entity explanations — is crafted to reduce mental load, encourage deep comprehension, and foster independent learning.

This project is deeply rooted in my belief that technology should simplify, not complicate. That’s why SimplifiED is intentionally clean, distraction-free, and focused on the essentials: learning smarter, not harder.

So whether you're a student prepping for exams, a curious learner tackling new topics, or just someone who wants to understand things faster — SimplifiED is built for you.

Let’s make education simpler, smarter, and more accessible — together.

        Whether you're a student tackling tough readings or a curious learner exploring new topics,
